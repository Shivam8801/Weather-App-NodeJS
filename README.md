# Weather-App-NodeJS

This project is a frontend and backend development project and is
a Weather App web application built using EJS, CSS3, Embedded
JavaScript(EJS), Node.js, and Express.js. The application is designed only
for development & learning purposes. The aim to build this project was
to apply my abilities to design a real-world web application. This web app
contains only one page on which weather data gets displayed on a card
with temperature, date, and weather description for any city in the world.

# Weather-App-NodeJS

This project is a frontend and backend development project and is
a Weather App web application built using EJS, CSS3, Node.js, and Express.js. The application is designed only
for development & learning purposes. The aim to build this project was
to apply my abilities to design a real-world web application. This web app
contains only one page on which weather data gets displayed on a card
with temperature, date, and weather description for any city in the world.

In order to use this app, user should install following modules on terminal(I have used VS Code)--
1) npm install express
2) npm install ejs
3) npm install --save express
4) npm install ejs --save
5) npm install body-parser --save

and then run node server.js to get the web app on http://localhost:3000/.
